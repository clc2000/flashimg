Flashimg is a tool used to create and handle flash image file.
you can read/write a binary file from/to a partition of your flash image file.
Very useful with Qemu. 

Compilation and installation

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

Usage
-----

Flashimg need a partition file to define all the partitions of your flash image file. Syntax:

flashimg -s [size] -t [flash type] -f [image file] -p [partition file] -w [partition name to write],[file] -r [partition name to read],[file]

-s size
    Size of the flash memory image file. The value can be write whith suffix K, M and G for KByte, MByte and GByte.
-t type
    Type of the flash nor or nand.
-f file
    Output file name.
-p file
    Partition file name
-w partition,file
    Write a file to a partition in flash image file.
-r partition,file
    Read partition from flash image file and write to file.
-z size
    Sector size of the flash (NAND flash only). 256, 512 or 2048.

Example for a 2MB file called nor.img where write the kernel and bootloader partition:

$ flashimg -s 2M -t nor -f nor.img -p boot.part -w boot,/.../bootloader/boot.bin -w kernel,/.../linux/arch/arm/boot/zImage

The partition file
------------------

The partition file format is one line per partition. Each line is the partition name, the partition length and the partition offset in flash.

Partition file example:

boot    0x00040000      0x00000000
env     0x00020000      0x00040000
kernel  0x00500000      0x00060000
root    0x03aa0000      0x00560000
